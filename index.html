    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>Outside of my classes and projects, here are a few things that pique my interest.</p>
    <h2>Speedcubing</h2>
    <p>I got into speedcubing when I was 13. My favorite puzzle is the 3x3 cube, but I also enjoy solving the
        2x2, 4x4, 5x5, and pyraminx. My personal best time on the 3x3 is 12.06 seconds.</p>
    <h2>Biking</h2>
    <p>I've been riding bikes ever since I was a little kid. Nowadays, I enjoy going on long-distance bike rides,
        both through my hometown and on bike trails, such as the Mohawk-Hudson bike trail in Upstate New York.
        It's not only a great way to get some fresh air and exercise, but also serves as a stress reliever.</p>
    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <p>I love traveling. I really enjoy seeing new places, learning about new cultures and history, and especially
        trying new cuisines. So far, I've visited 18 US states and 6 countries outside the US.</p>
